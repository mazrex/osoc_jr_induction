First README.md was modified on new_branch and changes were committed.
Then, again after checkout to the main branch, README.md was modified
and the changes were committed. This created a merge conflict. And,
the branches would not merge until the conflict was resolved.

The merge conflict was resolved using reset --hard command by going 
back to a state in main branch, where we could merge without getting
merge conflicts.
